`Version: 0.03` 

# Introduction

Welcome! This is an unofficial version of `Notion.so` electron app. Since NotionHQ is busy doing other amazing feature developments, Linux is low on its priority. Here is the tweet from them explaining that

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey we don&#39;t want to release on platforms that we cannot ensure the quality â€“ the team is still small and we don&#39;t use Linux ourselves </p>&mdash; Notion (@NotionHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/NotionHQ/status/912737143327301634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2017</a></blockquote>


So I decided to build my own app using `nativefier` 

Here is how it looks

# Installation

Simply clone this repo and run 

```bash
./install.sh 
```

### Native Notion

To get native Notion app running with offline capabilities, you can use this guide: https://github.com/puneetsl/lotion/issues/1

- Everything you would expect from Windows or Mac application except offline use

  - However there are ways to use windows app using this code to have offline capabilities ( [here](https://github.com/puneetsl/lotion/issues/1) is how you can do that )
  - I'll add a script to automatically install native Notion with all these capabilities soon

- Tray icon
